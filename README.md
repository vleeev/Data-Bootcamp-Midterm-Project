# Data-Bootcamp-Midterm-Project
Midterm Project for Data Bootcamp (ECON-UB 232)

The question I'm trying to answer is which neighborhood and school demographic factors best predict NYC public school performance?

The outcomes for performance are ELA proficiency, Math proficiency, as well as graduation rate.

The predictors that I'm looking to use are from the NYC demographic snapshot and census (ACS) which consist of school composition (Asian / Black / Hispanic / White shares), enrollment (school size), economic need index (proxy for poverty)
